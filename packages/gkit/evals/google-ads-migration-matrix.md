# Google Ads legacy CLI migration matrix

> Historical Slice 4 evidence. The final hard-cut decision in
> [`slice5-final-migration-matrix.md`](./slice5-final-migration-matrix.md)
> converts every `keep` row to `drop`; the package has been deleted.

## Decision rule

`replace` means the REST spike demonstrated the required provider behavior and
Slice 4 may implement the replacement; it does not mean the legacy command is
retired today. `keep` means an exact command behavior or a required live gate
is still missing. `drop` means the current sole consumer does not need the
legacy runtime-only operation in the REST product.

## `@deniffer/google-ads-cli`

| Legacy command | Decision | gkit target or missing gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `provider action install` | drop | REST is in-process and has no package-local Python environment to install |
| `doctor dataset readiness` | keep | gkit now validates the local single-account service-account profile, but it intentionally does not preserve legacy network/MCC readiness semantics |
| `customer dataset accounts` | replace | `google-ads.customers.list-accessible`; implemented contract and live artifact passed |
| `query dataset gaql` | replace | `google-ads.query.gaql`; pinned search, explicit pagination, raw page bundle, negative error, and live gate passed |
| `keywordPlan dataset ideas` | replace | `google-ads.keyword-plan.generate-ideas`; provider-native input, full-page live result, artifact, and prior legacy comparison passed |
| `keywordPlan dataset historicalMetrics` | replace | `google-ads.keyword-plan.generate-historical-metrics`; live REST and legacy comparison passed |
| `campaign dataset performance` | keep | generic GAQL is available, but the curated command's exact query/input/output golden has not run through gkit |
| `adGroup dataset performance` | keep | generic GAQL is available, but the curated command's exact query/input/output golden has not run through gkit |
| `keyword dataset performance` | keep | generic GAQL is available, but the curated command's exact query/input/output golden has not run through gkit |
| `searchTerm dataset performance` | keep | the larger REST query proved capacity, not the curated command's complete behavior contract |

## Package retirement verdict

The legacy Google Ads package is not deleted. Every `replace` row now exists in
gkit with contract tests and a live smoke, but doctor plus four curated
performance commands remain `keep`. The Python installer may be dropped only
when the package itself is finally retired. See
[`slice4-google-ads-baseline.md`](./slice4-google-ads-baseline.md) for the
productized evidence.
