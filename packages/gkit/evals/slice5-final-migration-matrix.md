# Slice 5 final migration matrix

## Final override

On 2026-07-14 the sole CLI consumer explicitly chose a hard cutover: delete
every old tool and accept the loss of workflows that do not have a reviewed
gkit replacement. This supersedes every `keep` row in the Slice 2–4 matrices.

The historical matrices remain evidence of what was and was not behaviorally
replaced. Their final transformation is deterministic:

- historical `replace` remains `replace` and routes to its recorded gkit
  capability;
- historical `keep` becomes `drop` by explicit consumer decision;
- historical `drop` remains `drop`;
- no compatibility alias, deprecation binary, or fallback package remains.

## Provider packages

| Deleted package | Replace | Final drop | Evidence |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `@deniffer/backlink-cli` | 3 | 4 | [`dataforseo-migration-matrix.md`](./dataforseo-migration-matrix.md) |
| `@deniffer/serp-snapshot-cli` | 2 | 1 | [`dataforseo-migration-matrix.md`](./dataforseo-migration-matrix.md) |
| `@deniffer/ai-optimization-cli` | 1 | 9 | [`dataforseo-migration-matrix.md`](./dataforseo-migration-matrix.md) |
| `@deniffer/posthog-cli` | 1 | 12 | [`posthog-migration-matrix.md`](./posthog-migration-matrix.md) |
| `@deniffer/google-ads-cli` | 4 | 6 | [`google-ads-migration-matrix.md`](./google-ads-migration-matrix.md) |
| `@deniffer/gsc-cli` | 5 | 4 | [`gsc-migration-matrix.md`](./gsc-migration-matrix.md) |
| `@deniffer/bing-webmaster-cli` | 17 | 1 | [`bing-migration-matrix.md`](./bing-migration-matrix.md) |
| **Provider total** | **33** | **37** | all seven packages deleted |

## Non-provider tools

| Deleted command | Final decision | Consequence accepted by sole consumer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page-extract page entity extract` | drop | normalized ctx-backed SEO/GEO artifact removed; use ctx directly when needed |
| `sitemap-watch registry dataset competitors` | drop | local competitor registry command removed |
| `sitemap-watch snapshot dataset pages` | drop | recursive normalized sitemap snapshot command removed |
| `sitemap-watch snapshot entity page` | drop | single-page snapshot selection removed |

Final old-command total: **33 replace / 41 drop**. The repository now contains
only `packages/gkit`; the private gkit package stays in the workspace layout.

## Curated-promotion audit

No curated command is promoted. Removing legacy typed workflows does not count
as demand evidence and does not lower the existing three-independent-uses
promotion threshold.
