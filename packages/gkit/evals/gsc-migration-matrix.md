# Google Search Console legacy CLI migration matrix

## `@deniffer/gsc-cli`

| Legacy command | Decision | gkit target or evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skill path` | drop | local package skill distribution is not a provider capability; generated docs replace discovery |
| `skill print` | drop | `gkit docs --provider gsc` and `gkit describe` are the canonical discovery surfaces |
| `skill install` | drop | the sole consumer uses the linked `gkit` binary; no package-local skill install is needed |
| `doctor dataset readiness` | keep | `gkit gsc doctor` validates local files, but intentionally does not preserve the legacy network probe |
| `property dataset sites` | replace | `gsc.properties.list`; legacy and gkit both returned two properties |
| `search dataset analytics` | replace | `gsc.search-analytics.query`; same dates, query dimension, and limit returned the same 25 rows |
| `sitemap dataset sitemaps` | replace | `gsc.sitemaps.list`; both returned one sitemap with the same raw provider facts |
| `sitemap entity sitemap` | replace | `gsc.sitemaps.get`; both returned the selected sitemap object |
| `inspection entity url` | replace | `gsc.url-inspection.inspect`; both returned the same indexed URL result |

## Package retirement verdict

The provider data surface is replaced, but the package remains through Slice 4
because its network-aware doctor is still `keep`. Its three skill helpers are
explicitly `drop`, not silently migrated. See
[`slice4-gsc-baseline.md`](./slice4-gsc-baseline.md).
