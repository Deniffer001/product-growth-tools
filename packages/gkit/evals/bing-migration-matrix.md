# Bing Webmaster legacy CLI migration matrix

> Historical Slice 4 evidence. The final hard-cut decision in
> [`slice5-final-migration-matrix.md`](./slice5-final-migration-matrix.md)
> converts every `keep` row to `drop`; the package has been deleted.

## Decision rule

`replace` requires the same real profile and representative input to pass in
both CLIs without losing provider facts. That gate passed for all 17 data
commands. `keep` remains appropriate for the network-aware legacy doctor,
whose reachability behavior is intentionally absent from the local-only gkit
doctor.

## `@deniffer/bing-webmaster-cli`

| Legacy command | Decision | gkit target or missing gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `doctor dataset readiness` | keep | `gkit bing doctor` validates local config but intentionally does not preserve the legacy network probe |
| `site dataset sites` | replace | `bing.sites.list`; both returned the same five sites |
| `traffic dataset rank` | replace | `bing.traffic.rank`; same seven rows |
| `traffic dataset queries` | replace | `bing.traffic.queries`; same 35 rows, with provider order varying between requests |
| `traffic dataset pages` | replace | `bing.traffic.pages`; same 28 rows |
| `traffic entity query` | replace | `bing.traffic.query`; same six rows for the selected query |
| `traffic entity pageQueries` | replace | `bing.traffic.page-queries`; same 26 rows, with provider order varying between requests |
| `traffic entity queryPages` | replace | `bing.traffic.query-pages`; same three rows |
| `traffic entity queryPage` | replace | `bing.traffic.query-page`; both returned the same valid empty result |
| `crawl dataset stats` | replace | `bing.crawl.stats`; same six rows |
| `crawl dataset issues` | replace | `bing.crawl.issues`; both returned the same valid empty result |
| `crawl entity settings` | replace | `bing.crawl.settings`; same settings object |
| `link dataset pages` | replace | `bing.links.pages`; same link-count object |
| `link entity url` | replace | `bing.links.url`; same URL-link object |
| `sitemap dataset feeds` | replace | `bing.sitemaps.list`; same one-sitemap result |
| `sitemap entity feed` | replace | `bing.sitemaps.get`; same four detail rows |
| `url entity info` | replace | `bing.urls.info`; same URL index object |
| `url entity traffic` | replace | `bing.urls.traffic`; same URL traffic object |

## Package retirement verdict

The provider data surface is replaced, but the package remains through Slice 4
because its network-aware doctor is still `keep`. See
[`slice4-bing-baseline.md`](./slice4-bing-baseline.md).
