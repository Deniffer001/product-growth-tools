# DataForSEO legacy CLI migration matrix

## Decision rule

`replace` means gkit has a reviewed manifest record, compatible provider
request behavior, provider-native result validation, a dry-run cost bound, and
a successful live gate. `keep` means at least one of those facts is still
missing. No command is dropped in Slice 2.

## `@deniffer/backlink-cli`

| Legacy command | Decision | gkit target or missing gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `doctor dataset readiness` | replace | `gkit --profile <app> dataforseo doctor` |
| `domain dataset summary` | replace | `dataforseo.backlinks.summary.live`; domain live gate passed |
| `domain dataset referringDomains` | replace | `dataforseo.backlinks.referring_domains.live`; limit/order live gate passed |
| `domain dataset anchors` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record |
| `page dataset summary` | keep | endpoint is exposed, but page-target behavior has no dedicated golden/live gate |
| `page dataset backlinks` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record |
| `page dataset anchors` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record |

The package stays because three command families remain `keep` and page summary
has not passed its own behavior gate.

## `@deniffer/serp-snapshot-cli`

| Legacy command | Decision | gkit target or missing gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `doctor dataset readiness` | replace | `gkit --profile <app> dataforseo doctor` |
| `query dataset results` | replace | `dataforseo.serp.google.organic.live.advanced`; US/en/desktop/windows/depth-10 live gate passed |
| `batch dataset results` | keep | gkit exposes one reviewed provider task per invocation; batch artifact behavior is not replaced |

The package stays because batch behavior is still `keep`.

## `@deniffer/ai-optimization-cli`

| Legacy command | Decision | gkit target or missing gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `doctor dataset readiness` | replace | `gkit --profile <app> dataforseo doctor` |
| `llmResponse dataset models` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record |
| `llmResponse entity live` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record or live gate |
| `llmMention dataset locationsAndLanguages` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record |
| `llmMention dataset availableFilters` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record |
| `llmMention dataset search` | keep | inventory-only; `$0.10` request floor exceeds the `$0.03` profile cap |
| `llmMention dataset topPages` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record |
| `llmMention dataset topDomains` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record |
| `llmMention dataset aggregatedMetrics` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record |
| `llmMention dataset crossAggregatedMetrics` | keep | no reviewed executable manifest record |

The package stays because every data workflow remains `keep`.

## Package retirement verdict

No legacy DataForSEO package is deleted in Slice 2. The unit of migration is a
command behavior, but a package can be removed only after all of its retained
commands have a `replace` or explicit `drop` decision.
